# Newspaper Article Classification

In this project we make an attempt to compare a few popular techniques for text classification
and study advantages and limitations of each. Techniques include Natural Language
Processing techniques ​(like bag-of-words, n-grams), Machine Learning techniques​(like
k-means clustering) and Deep Learning techniques​(like CNN). We will also try to understand
why we need alternatives to each technique. Eventually we look forward to solve the problem of
classifying Newspaper articles effectively. Such models can be very easily integrated into an
online news portal, which will reduce the human effort of manually categorizing every article
into classes.
